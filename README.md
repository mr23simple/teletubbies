## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
[Agriculture] How can we use technology to create a community-based information platform that will inform, equip, and empower farmers, as well as would-be farmers?


## ABSTRACT:
Create a web app/site and a mobile app intended for a Farm-to-Customer and Farm-to-Farm Business Model. This model will eliminate middlemen who profit more on the farmer’s produce. 


## RESOURCES / TOOLS:
* Web Application
* Mobile Application
* SMS


## BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY:
The aim of this solution is to empower farmers to sell their produce directly to businesses and individuals. Farmers will interact directly with their customer where they can sell their produce at a profit. 

## LOGISTICS:
The farmers may maximize their profits further as the government will extend assistance by providing a budget logistics. This will benefit the farmers in a way that the money that could have been spent for delivery will be allocated solely for their use and for the farm’s improvement.

## PROCUREMENT:
The app is also based on the FARM-TO-FARM Business Model which allows farmers to procure seeds from another farm.
